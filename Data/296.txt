Yet, there may be moments when a walker feels unable to go one more block without some nourishment. Not a full-fledged meal, but merely a warm drink or a light snack to refuel the spirits. UPPER midtown, with its abundance of shops and art galleries, is an ever-changing terrain for a stroll-and-stop type of peregrination. Yet, there may be moments when a walker feels unable to go one more block without some nourishment. Not a full-fledged meal, but merely a warm drink or a light snack to refuel the spirits. And not at an unwelcoming spot, with minimums and disapproving glances, but rather at a comfortable place to cool the heels - or these days, warm the toes. The following is a select list of weekend possibilities, arranged in a more-or-less geographic order running from south to north: Chez Laurence, Madison Avenue at 38th Street (683-0284). This small cafe-cum-pastry shop takes on a decided French air from its black-frocked, white-aproned waitresses. A wonderfully flaky warm croissant, served with the shop's own fruit preserves ($1.25), would go well with a frothy cappuccino ($1.75). Standouts in the pastry department are a lampion (a dense brioche-shaped cake with almond paste) at $2.25, and a mally tranche (an almond-flavored slice of brioche that leaves a shower of powdered sugar in the lap) at $1.75. A bran brioche studded with raisins ($1.50) is a recent experiment. A densely populated spot at breakfast and lunch hours, the cafe takes on a more relaxed pace midmorning or midafternoon. Fridays, 7 A.M. to 6:30 P.M. Grand Central Oyster Bar, lower level of Grand Central Terminal (490-6650). The takeout window, situated to the right of the main entrance of the Oyster Bar restaurant, is a convenient stand-up way station for a choice of some 14 oysters (95 cents to $1.85 apiece). Even more appealing on a cold day is a restorative bowl of New England or Manhattan clam chowder ($2.45). Beer, wine by the glass and mineral water are served. Fridays, 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. and 4 to 6:30 P.M. Museum of Modern Art Garden Cafe, 11 West 53d Street (708-9400). This refreshingly spartan and capacious cafe is a welcome relief from the crush of the city streets, and from its expanse of wide windows, one may contemplate Picasso's ''She-Goat,'' Rodin's ''Monument to Balzac,'' Henry Moore's ''Ani-mal Form,'' Claes Oldenburg's ''Geometric Mouse,'' and others. There are various possibilities for a light snack: for example, fruit yogurts ($1.25) with a Perrier ($1.25), hot chocolate ($1) with a pumpkin muffin ($1.30), or a cheese-and-fruit basket ($3.75) with a glass of red wine ($2.85). Fridays through Sundays, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. The Market, Citicorp Center, Lexington Avenue at 53d Street. Early morning or midafternoon, the center plaza of the Market resembles a peaceful, clean-swept little city square, where people relax with the daily newspaper at cafe tables under a filigree of green foliage. Various takeout shops in the mall provide light fare. At Cafe Buon Giorno (355-1914), there's hot cider (92 cents), egg cream ($1.25) or espresso ($1.34), but for an accompanying pastry, segue to Au Bon Pain (838-6996) for an enormous, swirling pancake-flat cinnamon or pecan roll ($1); Fridays, 6:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M., Saturdays, 9 A.M. to 8:30 P.M. and Sundays, 9 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. At Healthworks! (838-6221), there's frozen yogurt ($1.85), and at Nyborg & Nelson, a light gravelax sandwich ($4.95). Hours at Healthworks!: Fridays, 7 A.M. to 8 P.M.: Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Sundays, 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Hours at Nyborg & Nelson: Fridays, 7 to 10 A.M. and 11:30 A.M. to 9 P.M. and Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 7 P.M. The Casual Quilted Giraffe, 15 East 55th Street, at the A.T.&T. Arcade (593-1221). This double-tier diner, with gray leather banquettes and black granite tables, gives on to the cathedral-like arcade of Philip Johnson's Chippendale-topped skyscraper. Designed as an alternative space to the sumptuous Quilted Giraffe restaurant, the Casual Quilted Giraffe offers grazing food at more manageable prices. As a midafternoon booster, there are addictive little puffy pizzas combining ricotta cheese laced with Japanese wasabi mustard ($12), a root-beer float ($6) or one of the best malted milks in town ($6). Next door is the Casual Quilted Giraffe's just-opened companion with the very British-sounding name of the Lunchbox Clubbe and Kerryout. This offers cut-above-the-deli box lunches for midtown workers, yet if you want something appropriate to savor as you gaze in Tiffany's windows around the corner, there's a takeout of three caviar beggar's purses, a signature appetizer at the Quilted Giraffe, for $25. Fridays and Saturdays, 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. I.B.M. Arcade, Madison Avenue at 56th Street (407-3500). This spacious plaza, with spruce-green park benches and tall bamboo trees, has the atmosphere of a rather Dickensian town square this time of year, with its old-fashioned lamplights decked out with spiraling holiday wreaths. After a perusal of ''Tokyo: Form and Spirit,'' the exhibition of objects and images from the 19th century through the present, on view at the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art just off the arcade, a stroller might seek the form and spirit of refreshment. At the circular snack bar, why not a warm croissant and mulled cider or a cranberry muffin and herbal tea ($1.25 and $1, respectively)? Fridays and Saturdays, 8:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. Trump Tower, Fifth Avenue at 57th Street (832-2929). A little hideaway amid the hustle and bustle of Trump Tower is the vestpocket cafe tucked into a corner of Level 5. With a skylight overhead, it perches above the gushing marble waterfall and the lower levels' brass glitter. Adding to the benign setting is the unhurried service - sandwiches are prepared only when ordered, for example. The food arrives direct from the kitchen of the excellent Terrace Five restaurant across the way. A bracing choice would be the chef's soup of the day, which might turn out to be a cream of pumpkin or split pea ($4). Terrace Five itself - a minimal and sparkling setting - has recently introduced an afternoon tea, which rivals the Old-World classics to be found in the neighborhood (at the Palm Court at the Plaza, Fifth Avenue at 59th Street; the Rotunda at the Pierre, Fifth Avenue at 61st Street; the Pembroke Room at the Lowell, 28 East 63d Street; Le Regence, 37 East 64th Street; the Mayfair Lounge at the Mayfair Regent, Park Avenue at 65th Street). The Terrace Five's assorted tea sandwiches cost $8.50, but there are other temptations, such as a glass of champagne and one of the delicious homemade cakes ($5). A hot buttered rum ($6.50) is a real pick-me-up. Fridays and Saturdays, noon to 3 P.M. Terrace Five tea, from 3 to 5:30 P.M.  Tasting Bar, Bloomingdale's, Lexington Avenue at 59th Street (705-2992). This clublike nook on the ground level of Bloomingdale's has a small holly-green bar surrounding a center island where you can watch your order assembled. Midafternoon, the Tasting Bar is a haven for a sprightly dish of minted fresh pineapple ($2) and one of the SoHo Sodas ($1.50). If you're still in a celebratory holiday mood, and price is no object, there's a Petrossian platter ($18) of smoked salmon and two caviars, served with toast and creme fraiche and a glass of champagne. Fridays and Saturdays, 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. L'Omnibus, 21 East 61st Street (980-6988). If a sophisticated, pampering atmosphere is called for, this elegant Art Deco bistro might fill the bill. Sharing the kitchen with Maxim's, L'Omnibus offers alternative light fare at lightweight prices. During the low-key hours of 3 to 6 P.M., one could curl up in a plump cushioned booth for a gratinee des Halles (cheese-topped onion soup) for $3.95, or a gateau de fromage aux fraises (a cheesecake with strawberries) at ($4.50) and espresso ($2.50). Fridays through Sundays, noon to 10:30 P.M. Nirvana, 30 Central Park South (486-5700). Push the elevator button for the 15th floor at this address, and you will find yourself in an aerie with an incomparable view running to the tip of Central Park and beyond. While this Indian restaurant with its spangly, fussy decor would be more appealing when the lights were low, it's the view - particularly on a sunny, crisp winter afternoon - and the fact that the menu offers unusual light treats that make it worth a detour. Notably, there is a choice of seven breads ($2.95 to $4.95) - including the awesome balloon-shaped whole-wheat poori made to order - which might go well with a beer. Or, if it's nothing more than a health drink you're after, try aam lassi, a blend of mangoes and homemade yogurt ($2.95). Fridays through Sundays, noon to 1 A.M. Rumpelmayer's, in the St. Moritz Hotel, 50 Central Park South (755-5800). The bonus for a flagging shopper-stroller at this landmark establishment is to step in the door, plunk down on one of the dozen counter stools, and order a lemon ice cream soda ($3.95), chocolate marshmallow sundae ($4.70) or banana split ($5.70). Fridays through Sundays, 7 A.M. to 1A.M. Finally, for an Irish coffee pick-me-up, there's the Quiet Man, 40 West 45th Street (354-1432); Charley O's Bar and Grill, 33 West 48th Street (582-7141), and the Irish Pavilion, 130 East 57th Street (759-9040).
