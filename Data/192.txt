Chris Kinzer kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired today to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 victory over North Carolina State in the Peach Bowl and give Coach Bill Dooley a triumph in his final game at the school. Erik Chapman, the Hokies' quarterback, led the winning drive by completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards in the final 1 minute 53 seconds. The drive was helped by a 15-yard pass-interference penalty on the play immediately before Kinzer's field goal. Mike Cofer had kicked a 33-yard field goal with 7:12 left to give North Carolina State a 24-22 lead. The contest completed an 8-3-1 season for Dick Sheridan, the first-year North Carolina State coach, who took over a program that had suffered through three consecutive 3-8 seasons. Chapman Leads Comeback Chapman led the Hokies (9-2-1) back from a 21-10 halftime deficit as he connected on a 29-yard pass to Eddie Hunter to the 1-yard line following a fumble by Erik Kramer, the North Carolina State quarterback. Maurice Williams, who gained 129 yards on 16 attempts, dived over on the next play with 33 seconds left in the third period. The extra-point attempt failed, leaving the score 21-16. Virginia Tech made it 22-21 at 5:24 of the final quarter when Chapman connected with Steve Johnson on a 6-yard pass play following another fumble by Kramer. Both scoring passes by Kramer came following interceptions of Chapman. Derrick Taylor, who had one of the thefts for the Wolfpack, also blocked a punt in the opening quarter that was recovered in the end zone by Brian Bulluck for North Carolina's first score. Baylor 21, Colorado 9 HOUSTON (AP) - Baylor's defense shut down Colorado's wishbone attack and set up Derrick McAdoo for two 1-yard touchdown dives to lead the Bears to victory in the 28th Bluebonnet Bowl. Ray Berry, voted Baylor's most valuable player in the game, and Keith Rose, a tackle, recovered Buffalo fumbles to set up McAdoo's touchdown runs as Baylor ended a string of three straight losses in the bowl by Southwest Conference teams. Colorado, 6-6 for the season, lost three of six fumbles and had one pass intercepted. Berry's recovery at the Colorado 20 on the second play of the third quarter raised the Bears' lead to 21-3. Colorado got its touchdown with 2:38 to go in the third period on a 31-yard run by Mark Hatcher, the quarterback. The touchdown narrowed Baylor's lead to 21-9, but Berry tackled Cameron Jones on a 2-point conversion attempt. The versatile Baylor offense took advantage of a fine defensive effort for a 14-3 halftime lead on McAdoo's first score and Cody Carlson's 2-yard pass to Darnell Chase. Carlson completed his first eight passes to eight Baylor receivers. When he went to Chase for the second time, it was a 2-yard touchdown in the corner of the end zone. Colorado's only first-half score came on a 36-yard field goal by Dave DeLine, who then missed a 41-yard attempt with 9 seconds to go in the half. Baylor ended its season with a 9-3 record and its second straight bowl victory. The Bears defeated Louisiana State, 21-7, in the 1985 Liberty Bowl. Iowa 39, San Diego State 38 SAN DIEGO (AP) - Rob Houghtlin's 41-yard field goal as time expired Tuesday night gave Iowa (9-3) the victory in the Holiday Bowl.

Two running plays sandwiched round an incomplete pass moved the ball to the 24 with 4 seconds left. Houghtlin then kicked the winning field goal, capping a fourth quarter in which the lead changed hands three times in the last 4:26. San Diego State (8-4) led by 21-13 at the half and by 28-21 after three quarters. Then it took a 35-21 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter when Chris Hardy ran 6 yards for a touchdown.
